# Cluster Analysis with PyCaret
This Python script performs cluster analysis using different clustering techniques, including K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering, and Birch Clustering. It utilizes the PyCaret library for clustering and visualization.

## Setup

Install the required libraries using pip:
'''
pip install pycaret
'''

## Assignment Overview
The following tasks are performed in the assignment:

1. The clustering is performed for different algorithms in the notebook.
2. After this, tables are formed for each algorithm based on scores of different no. of clusters (c=3,4,5) on different parameters(normalization,transformation etc).(attached CSV files)
3.  Visualize the clustering results using various plots, including an elbow plot(to check the number of appropriate clusters), silhouette plot, and distribution plot.

-The plots, graphs, etc. are in the notebook for better visualization.

## Additional Notes

* The dataset used in this script is the Jewellery dataset, which is found in Pycaret library under clustering datasets.
* Different preprocessing techniques such as normalization, transformation, and PCA are applied to the data before clustering.
